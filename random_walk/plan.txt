DATA VISUALIZATION PLAN
-Exploring data through visual representation
-Explorong patterns and connections in data set.

-We can analizy numerical and non-numerical data.
This includes the use of differnet libarries.
1. Matplotlib: A mathematical library
2. Plotly: Create the visualzation on digital devises and resizes to fit screen

###
cd in data-visualization and install: python -m pip install --user matplotlib

Adjusting the plat to be clearer
Step 1: Chart title and label axis, adjust line width

NB: When we gove plot a sequence of numbers it assumes that the first data points correspnds to an (x,x) value (0) but cases where the (x,x) value is one is output an incorrect response. Thus overwrite defautlt by specifying some input value

Step 2:
Styling our plots
--inside python --import matplotlib.pyploy as plt -plt.style.available

Step 3: Adding color
c=(0, 0.8, 0.5) or c='Gree'

Using a color map;

		EXR2
Create a random_walk program from the random module. 
In order to visualize write a python program using the matplotlib.pyplot

---Create emphasis on the map, where the walk began and where it ends, paths. Use a cmap for emphasis on specified areas.

First: Generate a range for the diff points. 

--Highlighting starting and ening point of our random_walk chart.
(make end points larger, and more visble)

--Remove axis from plot, and show the outcome.
--Increase the number of walks. use the RandonWalk class.
--Automatically adjust screen size as walk increases. Introduce figsize into the subplot().
-Add a resolution (dpi) to the above.


		PROJECT 2
This invlves visualizing data from data-sets provided.(Chap. 16). Data is in csv and JSON format.

We use the python csv module which is a standard library that passes a line in a csv files allow us to quickly extract valyues.

NB: What is important to our project is Date of Recod, TMAX, TMIN.
--Print oue each header and its position on the list. BY looping over the index, and column_header; This will output the above for use.
--Now that you have info on the exct index for each colum header, iterate over for high temp.
--Visualize the resule

Exr 2
Adding date to graph.
In the file date is represented in a string, we must read the date in as a string and need an module to convert it into an object representing the date that can be used in our plot	.  To achieve we need a method from the "datetime" module.

--from datetime import datetime
--Specify date eg:
first_date = datetime.strptime('2018-07-01', '%Y-%m-%d')
print(first_date)

--Add the lows to see the new chart look. Then tone down the color.
--Add an averge of the plot, but first add an (alpha value) for transparency of each graph and a (fill_between).

NB: MIssing data can cause exceptions that may lead ourprogram to CRASH.
-Use the try except error handling to resolve error.
